Project Requirements vary project by project, but a general set is as follows:



## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
